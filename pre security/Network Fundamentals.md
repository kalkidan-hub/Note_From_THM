*what is network?*
- The connectedness of things.
*what is internet?*
- Giant network with the collection of small networks
*how devices in the network identified?*
1. An IP Address,
		- private ==our name==
		- public ==our county==
	Two versions are out there, 
		- ipv4 (of 32 bit length)
		- ipv6 (of 128 bit length)
		
2. A MAC(Media Access Control) Address ==our fingerprint== . Has the following format, has a 48 bit length, 2 byte separated by a semicolon
		```a4:c4:f0:85:cf:2f```

**pinging**
```ping IP address or website URL```
By making use of ==ICMP (internet control message protocol)==

**Topology**

- topology is a network design
LAN(local area network) topologies
1. Star Topology - individual networks connected via a center networking devices, such as switch or hub.
2. Bus Topology - devices are leaf out from the the main stream known as backbone cable. Bottleneck and overwhelmingness are major drawbacks of this topology.
3. Ring(token) Topology - devices are token together connected in a loop, the packet is sent across the loop and it travels up until it reaches its destination device. The major drawback is that there is no alternative path in which the packet travels hence a break at any single point causes the shut down of the whole communication.
