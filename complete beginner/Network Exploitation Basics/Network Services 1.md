#### SMB(Server Message Block protocol)
- client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other network resources. 
- known as response-request protocol because it transmits multiple messages to establish a connection between client and server. The connection is done using NetBIOS over TCP/IP. 
#### SMB enumeration
##### EnumLinux
- a tool used to enumerate SMB.
- syntax
```zsh
enum4linux [option] ip
```

**OPTION**          **FUNCTION**  

-U             get userlist  
-M             get machine list  
-N             get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)  
-S             get sharelist  
-P             get password policy information  
-G             get group and member list

-a             all of the above (full basic enumeration)
#### SMB exploitation
- looking for a common mis configuration that can allow us to gain information that will lead to a shell.
*accessing SMB share...*
```zsh
smbclient //[ip]/[share] -u[user_name] -p[port]
```
for instance 
```zsh
smbclient //10.10.10.2/secret -u suit -p 445
```
to access an SMB share called "secret" as user "suit" at default port "445"

#### Telnet
- an application protocol which allow,with the use of telnet client, users to connect and execute commands on a remote machine.
- syntax
```zsh
telnet [ip] [port]
```
*Shell vs Reverse shell...*
##### shell
- a piece of code or program which can be used to gain code or command execution on a device.
##### reverse shell
- a type of shell in which the target machine communicates back to the attacking machine.
- the attacking machine has a listening port, on which it receives the connection.
```zsh
sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0
```
This starts a tcpdump listener, specifically listening for ICMP traffic, which pings operate on.


#### FTP(File Transfer Protocol)
- A protocol used to allow remote transfer of files over a network. It uses a ==client-server== model to do this, and whose standard port is `20/21` 
- Supports two types of connections
	- Active - the client opens a port and listens
	- passive - the server opens a port and listen.
- Operates using two channel, 
	- a command (control) channel
	- a data channel
	While both data and commands are transferred over the network unencrypted, therefor exposed to a `man in the middle` attack.

##### Hydra
- a fast online password cracking tool
- syntax
```zsh
hydra -t 4 -l [user] -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV [machine ip] ftp
```
SECTION             FUNCTION  
  
hydra                   Runs the hydra tool  
  
-t 4                    Number of parallel connections per target  
  
-l [user]               Points to the user who's account you're trying to compromise  
  
-P [path to dictionary] Points to the file containing the list of possible passwords  
  
-vV                     Sets verbose mode to very verbose, shows the login+pass combination for each attempt  
  
[machine IP]            The IP address of the target machine  
  
ftp / protocol          Sets the protocol
