### NFS (Network File System)

- is a distributed file system protocol that allow user on a client computer to access files over a computer network, it's been built on ==Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call==(ONCRPC) system.
- How does it works?
	1. the client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory
	2. an RPC call is placed to NFSD(NFS daemon) on the server, which takes parameters like file handle, name of file, user's user ID and user'f group ID
	3. the server checks if the client has permission to do so
	4. then the access shall be granted

```zsh 
/usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP]
```
this command is used to list the NFS shares of the machine IP.
```zsh
sudo mount -t nfs [IP]:share /tmp/mount -nolock
```
- mount - executes the mount command
- -t nfs  - type of device to mount, here it is nfs
- IP:share - IP address of the NFS server and the name of the share we wish to mount
- -nolock - specifies not to use NLM(Netwowrk_Lock_Manager) locking
