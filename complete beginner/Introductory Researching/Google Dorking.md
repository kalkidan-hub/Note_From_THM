#### Crawling 

>*What is it?*

Crawling is the process by which search engines discover new and updated content on the internet. It involves navigating through web pages and ==following links== to find other pages.

>*How it's done:*
 
Crawlers use algorithms to determine which pages to visit, how often to revisit them, and which links to follow. They typically prioritize pages based on factors like page relevance, popularity, and freshness. Crawlers parse the content of web pages, extracting information such as text, links, images, and metadata. This information is then sent back to the search engine's servers for processing and indexing.

#### Indexing

>*What is it?*

Indexing is the process of organizing and storing the crawled web pages in a structured format, making them searchable

>*How it's done:*

involves various steps, including text analysis (breaking down the content into words or phrases), tokenization (converting words into searchable tokens), and building data structures (like inverted indexes) to efficiently store and retrieve information.
