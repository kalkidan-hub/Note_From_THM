* `reverse` shell - when we force the remote server to connect to our server.
	* the listener runs on the attacker's machine
	* the target connects to the attacker's machine with a shell
	* the attacker doesn't need to know the victim's IP
* `bind` shell - when we force remote server to open up a port which we can connect to in order to execute further commands. 
	* the listener on the server computer
	* the attacker need to know the IP address of the victim
