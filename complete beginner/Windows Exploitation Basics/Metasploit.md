_What is all the fuss about_

![[Pasted image 20240414135144.png]]

- Metasploit is a penetration testing framework that makes hacking simple. 
- point metasploit at your target, pick an exploit, or payload to drop and hit `Enter` 
- Metasploit framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more
- It has these main components,...
	- `msfconsole` (metasploit framework console) - the main command-line interface
	- `modules` - supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc
	- `tools` - stand-alone tools


### Components
- **Exploit:** A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
- **Vulnerability:** A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
- **Payload:** An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.
#### Modules
1. Auxiliary  - Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers, can be found here.
2. Encoders - allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them.
3. Evasion - makes a direct attempt to evade antivirus software
4. Exploits 
5. NOPs(No Operation) do nothing. They are represented in the Intel x86 CPU family with 0x90, following which the CPU will do nothing for one cycle. They are often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes.
6. Payloads - codes that will run on the target machine
   You will see four different directories under payloads: adapters, singles, stagers and stages.

- **Adapters:** An adapter wraps single payloads to convert them into different formats. For example, a normal single payload can be wrapped inside a Powershell adapter, which will make a single powershell command that will execute the payload.  
    
- **Singles:** Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run.
- **Stagers:** Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. “Staged payloads” will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once.
- **Stages:** Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads.
  Metasploit has a subtle way to help you identify single (also called “inline”) payloads and staged payloads.

- generic/shell_reverse_tcp - `single`
- windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp - `staged papload`
  
7. Post - useful on the final stage, post-exploitation

### `msfconsoling` 
to use a module, use  `use path_to_the_module`

```msfconsole

use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
```

The prompt tells us we now have a context set in which we will work. You can see this by typing the show options command.

To get out of current context/module do `back`
Want more information, do `info`
Looking for something, do `search`
To set values to parameters do `set parameter_name value`
To clear the values set to parameters do `unset parameter_name`
To clear all set parameters do `unset all`
All set, wanted to launch the attack, do `exploit` or `run`
Want the session go away from you, but still run do `ctrl + Z` or `bg`
Wanna see sessions you currently have, do `sessions`
To enter to another session do `session -i session_id`
