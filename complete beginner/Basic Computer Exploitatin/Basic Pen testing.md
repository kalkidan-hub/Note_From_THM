### basic scanning
- `nmap`
- `dirsearch`

### brute-forcing to find username and password

- `enum4linux` to scan `smb`
- `hydra` to figure our the password of the user just found 
- `ssh` to the machine with credentials found

### looking for a way to privilege escalation
- `LinPEAS` [found here](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) for privilege escalation scanning
- found a key for another user  `kay` - could perform `horizontal privilege escalation` 
- `ssh2john` to find out the passphrase for the found `ssh private key` 
- log in to user `kay`
